# Marketing-ROI-Prediction

TEAM ROI – Final Project Berkeley

Objectives:

1)	Improve current forecasting methods (linear regression, historical performance and manual touches based on industry and business knowledge). New process is to rely on machine learning to define the best forecasting model and improve accuracy.

2)	Forecast the Revenue contribution of individuals sites based on their previous performance. 

Premises: 
•	Ad spend is pre-defined as a proposal of overall spend and is given to the analysts by media planners.
•	CPM is also a manual input that is informed by Media Planners, which is the rate pre-negotiated with partners that will run media.


To be forecasted:
1)	Revenue.
a.	Once Revenue is forecasted, the other conversions forecast will follow, such as Reservations, Room Nights and ROI. Room nights can be defined based on either another model or just based on historical Average Daily Rate and Reservations can be then forecasted based on historical Length of Stay.
2)	With the Revenue forecasted, we will be able to calculate the projected efficiency metric (ROI or E/R)


Digital Marketing/Hotel Metrics Glossary:

•	Media Channel: A group of several publishers/sites with the same medium. In example, Facebook and Twitter are part of the Social media channel. Possible channels in this data set: Display (TripAdvisor, Expedia, etc), Search (Google/Bing/Yahoo) and Social (Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat)

•	Campaign: A Campaign is a time-limited action to increase certain results. The success of the campaign can be measured. Examples: Sending of newsletter with link to a landing page. Activation of paid keywords in search engines. Banner advertising or affiliate campaigns.

•	Impression:  a single instance of an online advertisement being displayed. The impression shows how often a page, a teaser or a banner was displayed.

•	Click: The action of clicking on an ad.
•	Ad Spend:
•	CPM: Cost per thousand Impressions.
•	CR (Conversion Rate): The rate at which user that clicked on a banner and then completed the predefined goal. Calculation: Conversions/Clicks
•	CTR (Click-Through-Rate): A metric showing how often people click on an ad or search result after they see it. Calculation: Clicks/Impressions
•	E/R: Expenses divided by Revenue. It is an inverse ROI calculation: the lower, the better.
•	Reservations: Amount of Orders.
•	Room nights: amount of nights a guest has booked the room for. Example: 1 reservation with 2 rooms, check-in in date is 10/18, check out is 10/20 will have a total of 4 Room nights (2 nights per room)
•	ADR: Average Daily Rate of the rooms purchased.
•	LoS: Length of stay (average number of nights across all sales)
•	CPRN: Cost/Room night. Another industry KPI, but it is irrelevant for this project.
